Inventory Tracker is a simple inventory system that allows users to add items and their details including price, quantity, purchase date and description. Product quantity can be increased or decreased and items can be deleted within individual product cards on the home page. The app also allows users to search images from UnSplash to use when adding a product. 

I built this project to practice my React skills and practice seting up and using Firesbase Firestore and Hosting. 

View and try the project live: 

Check it out on GitHub: https://github.com/nikkigraybeal/inventory-tracker

If you pull the project down to try locally, you will need an UnSplash API key to make the image search functionality work. 

Go to unSplash Developer page to sign up and get an API key.

Create a .env file at the root of the project directory and add your API key at the top of the file like so: REACT_APP_UNSPLASH_API_KEY="your-api-key-goes-here"
